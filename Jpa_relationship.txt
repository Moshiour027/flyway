When using the Java Persistence API(JPA) it is often necessary to create relationship between two entities.
These relationship are defined with the data model (think database) through the use of foreign keys and 
within our object model(think java) using annotations to indicate associations. When defining relationship
of associations within the object model a common task is indentitfying the owning side 
of the relationship. Identify the owning entry within a relationship is important because the owing
side is most often, if not always, where the @JoinColumn annotations must be specified.

@Entity
@Table(name="SERIES")
public class Series {

	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
	@Column(name="SERIES_ID")
	private Integer seriesId;

	@Column(name="TITLE")
	private String title;

	//Accessors...
}

@Entity
@Table(name="POST")
public class Post {

	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
	@Column(name="POST_ID")
	Integer postId;

	@Column(name="TITLE")
	String title;

	@Column(name="POST_DATE")
	Date postDate;

	@ManyToOne
	@JoinColumn(name="SERIES_ID")
	private Series series;

	//Accessors...
}

In the post entity the @JoinColumn annotations is specified 
obove the field series to denote the foreign key to be used
to Identify a Post's respective Series.
