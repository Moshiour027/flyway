1. The prerequisite is to install Powershell tools and management object of SQL Server according to the version
when SQL server was install .

Then in Powershell the 
        Import-Module sqlps
will work and to make that meaning to make sure the import of Powershell scripts are available 
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

must be set -- this means this will allow only trusted scripts to run on Powershell.

After Importing the sqlps
        If typed in Powershell 
            Get-PsProvider 

            we will see all the modules and sqlps as well this is because we imported it via Import-Module sqlps command

            then we can simply cd into virtual directories if required.



Explanation about he PSScript---
             $serverPath="SQLSERVER:\SQL\RAHMAN\MOSHIOUR_DB"

            as we can notice this is enviornment specific..

            To see all the available commands in sqlps module the command is 

            
Get-Command -Module sqlps
